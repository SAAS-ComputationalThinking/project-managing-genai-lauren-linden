This is awesome!  It's a great, workable version of the game.  You've handled the animations and game controls well and it's very playable.

It does feel to me like the pipe locations maybe don't vary quite enough -- there should be a few more big shifts up or down, where it kind of feels like they are all in the middle.  How would you make adjustments to accomplish that?

 * Do you feel that you understand the code at this point?
 * Do you feel that you understand what you would need to change to make adjustments at this point?
 * How was the process of gpt for you?  What was difficult about it?
